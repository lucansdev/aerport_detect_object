# airport_detect_object

### Information
  - This project its a object detection to detect dangerous objects in the bag of the people in the aerpport.
  - I used YOLO technique to be more faster in the prediction and more effective
  - The dataset i used its this:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/x-ray-baggage-anomaly-detection, all the dataset i training my neural network its from there.
  - I used meanIoU as metrics to know if my AI its good, because they use the difference between the pred square and the true square.
